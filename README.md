## The challenge

My challenge was to build a password generator app with the following user capabilities:

- Generating a password based on selected inclusion options
- Copying the generated password to the clipboard and pasting it
- Resetting all settings to default (except the welcome message)
- Choosing the character length of the password
- Generating passwords that include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols if all checkboxes are checked
- Displaying a message when the settings are reset
- Displaying a "Copied!" message when the password is copied
- Showing and hiding the reset message and copy message
- Applying hover and focus states to all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

My mission was to implement a password generator with customizable options and clipboard functionality. This involved manipulating strings and generating secure passwords based on user preferences.

- I gained experience in interacting with the clipboard, allowing users to easily copy and paste generated passwords for convenience and security.
- Resetting the user interface to default settings enabled a fresh start.
- I learned how to handle user input, validate it, and provide appropriate feedback for a seamless user experience.
- Applying CSS styling and incorporating interactive states like hover and focus improved the visual appeal and interactivity of the app, enhancing user engagement.
- Throughout the project, I developed problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and a structured approach to coding, contributing to my growth as a web developer.

## My favorite code from this challenge:

I needed to display a message for a short time when the button was clicked. So I found this solution for this problem. This JavaScript code snippet adds a click event listener to an element with the ID copyBtn.

- When clicked, it sets the opacity of an element with the ID msg to 1, making it visible.
  Using setTimeout, it then sets the opacity back to 0 after a delay of 1800 milliseconds (1.8 seconds).
- Finally, the function copyToClipboard() is called, performing the action of copying something to the clipboard.

```js
copyBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  msg.style.opacity = '1';

  setTimeout(() => {
    msg.style.opacity = '0';
  }, 1800);
  copyToClipboard();
});
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to improve in the following areas:

- Data Fetching: Enhancing data fetching techniques, working with APIs, and handling asynchronous programming.

- State Management: Improving state management in larger applications using solutions like Redux.
